You peel off pedals from a flower to find out if your true love loves you â€“ or not. The game uses a set formula to calculate from your name and your loved ones name, to decide the outcome of the game.

**Comments:**

This was a "stupid idea" my spouse an I had in late Valentine's Day evening. Took about 3 hours from the idea to a completed game. My contribution was mainly the graphics and how to get the flower assembled.

**What I could have done better:**

I was so slow at making my part, that my spouse did almost everything himself!

**Lesson learned:**

Don't try to embark on a project with too strict schedule. We finished the game just before midnight and had we got more time, the outcome could have been a lot more professional.
