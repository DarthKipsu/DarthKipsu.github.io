This was the first version of my website darth.kipsu.fi. The site is fully created with Clojure, using only [Less](//lesscss.org/) for stylesheets. I went with Clojure as I wanted to learn more about creating websites with a functional approach.

Frontend is created using [Hiccup](//github.com/weavejester/hiccup) for representing HTML. Hiccup syntax is an intelligent and minimal way to create HTML structuring and requires less boilerplate than regular HTML.

Backend uses basic [Ring](//github.com/ring-clojure) and [Compojure](//github.com/weavejester/compojure) combination to create a REST API with the site content to serve for the UI. The site content is stored in a [PostgreSQL](//postgresql.org/) database, mainly as text fields containing HTML. Changes to the database need to be handwritten from the console.

Testing has been made for all the logical functions throughoutly. Also some of the UI components have been tested.

With photography part of the site I decided to go with a different strategy. Uploading new photos and galleries was made really easy, I only needed to create a new directory, dumb the images and their thumbnails there and the gallery pages are generated by reading the directory.

All code for the site is open source and can be found from the [GitHub repo](//github.com/DarthKipsu/KipsuFi).

**Comments:**

This project was a lot of fun. I wanted to find out how easy it would be to make some bigger site using Clojure and found the language suiting for web development really nicely.

**What I could have done better:**

I should have made some kind of program to automate some nasty parts of creating content like for example creating thumbnails for photo galleries. Also upkeeping the database with posts was not handled as conveniently as it could have.

**Lesson learned:**

I learned a lot about using Lisp languages and creating functional code. I learned to love Clojure.
