The first session of Reaktor Academy is behind me and I'm left inspired by the talk about teamwork.

For background, in a traditional software project, the team is lead by a team manager, who delegates the tasks needed to get the project done. Each team member is mostly interested in getting their own work load done and if one member in the team gets overwhelmed with their tasks, it means that person is in trouble and everyone else are waiting for him/her to finish the tasks. This usually means the production advances in quite a steady phase and it's quite predictable how the project will make progress, but has also lead to trouble, as the product might not meet the expectations of clients, production takes ages and bugs easily creep into the source code.

One better approach to software developing could be **self organizing** teams. In these teams, everyone is similarly responsible for the project, have a similar say in the developing process and maybe most importantly, has all the knowledge needed to make decisions openly available. The team consists of members with varying competence areas and expertise and should contain all the knowledge needed to finish the project. Let's see why self organized teams might do so well:

### Product ownership

In a self organizing team, it's important for the whole team to be accountable for the end product. Everyone must feel like it's their job to ensure good craftismanship in working with the product, which means that whenever someone spots something that's not right in their view, that person should take action to have it fixed. All information is also transparent. This is to ensure everyone has enough knowledge to make the right decisions concerning the product.

Feeling like it's our project, rather than just fulfilling task given to from someone else and having enough information to create the best product for the need will lead to each team member doing their best towards a single goal.

### Product expectations

The whole team should be close to the customer, so that everyone knows the motives behind the product. The team should try to create a product that will answer to the need of the customer, rather than just doing what it's told. It's often that a software engineering team will have the expertise to realise what is needed for the customer and fulfill those needs better than what the customer is able to write down as a list of requirements.

There's always some needs and motives behind a product. Without, it's no use building anything. The team should try to find those exact needs and motives, to create a product that matches them as well as possible. The main purpose of the project is to create value for the customer, not just fulfill given requirements, that might not be what the customer really wanted.

### Build - measure - learn

Catching motives is also why the project needs to be built in steps and validated between each step. If the product is fully built and this is where the customer will get the chance to test it the first time, what happens if it wasn't what they had in mind? With the team being close to the customer and giving the customer every change to test it during the productions, mistakes in interpreting the requirements given will be catched early and fixed.

The team should always be aware of what they are building, why, and once they have something working, they need to validate if they got it right. This will lead to an expedient product, something that will give the most value to the customer.

### Timetable

It might take a bit of time for the team to organize at first and find the ways of working best suitable for that team. But once they have found it, the productivity of the team will not be dependent of the weakest link. The productivity will in fact first be less than with a traditional team but soon surpass them considerably, as shown in the graph below.

In addition to being more productive, the team will also need to ensure they are constantly doing what is most valuable to the customer. This way the end product will have the most needed features and will fulfill the motives behind it as well as possible. This can be done with a well maintained product backlog, that's kept up to date with the help of the customer.

An environment of openness and responsibility will reward the team members with a way to be instrumental in their work. They will feel more respect towards each other and be more involved in the project and improving their own skill set. This is an environment for growth, both in professional and individual level, something I'm sure most developers and designers desire.

While the team should have all the competency needed for the project inside it (outside consulting will always widen the gap between what was said and heard), self organizing team structure also greatly benefits from overlapping skills. It's actually an easy environment to widen your skill set, which is always useful. There should also be some experienced team members, because it might be difficult for a full team of novels to pull this off.
